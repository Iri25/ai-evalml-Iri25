Introduction to the development of self-learning systems. Types of problems that can be solved with machine learning methods (regression and classification). 
Measures to evaluate their performance methods.

Theoretical aspects:

1.Classification of problems that require machine learning methods.
2. Designing self-learning systems.

3. Evaluation of self-learning systems. Performance values: Error

4.Precision, Accuracy, Recall,

5. Cost function
